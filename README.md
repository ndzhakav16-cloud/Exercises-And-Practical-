# Exercises-And-Practical-SQL – JOIN, UNION & UNION ALL,SQL Fundamentals Exercise

- This repository contains SQL practice questions covering JOIN operations, UNION, and UNION ALL,SQL Fundamentals Exercise,SQL Date Functions Exercise, created to strengthen SQL querying skills used in data analysis and relational database operations.DATE FUNCTIONS, focusing on various SQL date and time manipulation operations across different database scenarios.

  # Purpose of the Project
The aim of this repository is to demonstrate practical SQL capabilities across multiple key concepts:
- Understanding relational data
- Joining multiple tables
- Combining datasets using UNION and UNION ALL
- Handling NULLs and missing relationships
- Performing record-level and table-level comparisons
- Basic SELECT statements
- Filtering with WHERE clauses
- Sorting with ORDER BY
- Limiting results
- Using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Working with IN and NOT IN operators
- Date Arithmetic Functions
          DATEADD() - Add intervals to dates (months, days, years)
          DATEDIFF() - Calculate differences between dates
          CURRENT_DATE / GETDATE() - Get current date
Date Formatting Functions
          TO_CHAR() - Format dates as strings
          DATE_FROM_PARTS() - Create dates from components
          Date part extraction (year, month, day, hour, minute)
Date Conversion Functions
        TO_DATE() - Convert strings to dates
        EXTRACT() - Extract specific parts from dates  
        DATE_PART() - Alternative extraction method
Timestamp Operations
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - Get current date and time
        Time component extraction
        Second-level time differences

# Objectives

This project helps develop the ability to:
- Use INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
- Combine result sets using UNION and UNION ALL.
- Interpret expected outputs and structure queries correctly.
- Work with orders, customers, and products datasets in common relational scenarios.
- Understand where NULLs appear in joins and how they affect results.
- Basic Retrieval - SELECT all columns
- Distinct Values - Finding unique departments
- Sorting - ORDER BY with DESC
- Limiting Results - TOP 5 highest paid
- Filtering - WHERE clause with single condition
- Multiple Conditions - AND operator
- Alternative Conditions - OR operator
- Exclusion - NOT operator
- Set Membership - IN operator
- Complex Filtering - Multiple AND conditions
- Combined Operations - OR, AND with sorting
- Exclusion Sets - NOT IN
- Date Sorting - ORDER BY with dates
